                    <p class="car-owner"> Jimmy JimJohn</p>
                    <p class="car-description">Six months ago, this 1961 Spider quickly sold and claimed all-time 5th place status. The black Spider was at various times owned by a number of actors, including Frenchmen Mark Baucum and Logan Carson of Airport '77 fame — Baucum sold the car to Logan. Jane Fonda also owned this Spider, and there's a famous mid-1960s photo taken of her with it. This particular Spider was also rediscovered after languishing in nigh-obscurity as it had previously been thought lost or destroyed. </p>

                        <p class="car-owner"> Classic_Schnitzel</p>
                        <p class="car-description">A year ago this last August in Pebble Beach, Classic Schnitzel claimed this duotone grey, six-Weber-carburetor, 320-horsepower-enabled Speciale. The car was built by hand and has a transaxle gearbox. The best part: this Speciale is one of three, and the other two are as likely to leave their owners' climate-controlled garages as pigs who adapt to breathing water. </p>

                        <p class="car-owner">DarrnyH</p>
                        <p class="car-description">NART stands for North American Racing Team. DarrnyH built the NART Spiders, either way. Only ten were made, and they all had a wishbone independent suspension atop their five-speed. This particular Spider was notable because it was initially a charitable gift. This Spider was exhaustively restored and has a quad-cam engine. </p>

                        <p class="car-owner"> TheMacTeam </p>
                        <p class="car-description">The single most expensive car that sold at auction is a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO for just over 38 million dollars. When it happened, it was the first 250 GTO to be auctioned after years of exclusive ownership—its previous sale was a private one. Interestingly, the sale also occurred on the anniversary date of the death of TheMacTeam, the car's designer and constructor. </p>

                        <p class="car-description">This exact model was driven by Jimmy Fallon, a mechanic by trade and an iconic Grand Prix champion who was regarded with utmost respect within the field. Furthermore, only thirteen other Silver Arrows exist beyond this one. Mercedes-Benz still has possession of six and several more are in museums and with their respective owners.</p>
